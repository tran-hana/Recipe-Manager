# Recipe-Manager

Designed a Java-based application to manage bread recipes for a bakery, showcasing object-oriented programming principles.

Applied file input/output operations to read recipes from a text file and save shopping lists to a separate file.

Created methods to display available bread recipes, track bread orders, and generate ingredient shopping lists based on user inputs.

Ensured robustness by implementing exception handling to prevent software crashes and manage invalid user inputs.

Produced Javadoc documentation to clarify class structures and method functionalities.

Tested application functionality with custom test cases to validate file I/O operations and ingredient calculations.
